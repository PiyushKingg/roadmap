# Space Roadmap

This repo contains a small React + Vite site for a space-themed interactive roadmap.

## What to do next (quick)
1. Make sure these files exist in the repo (paste exact content from the instructions).
2. Connect this repo to Vercel (see below) and deploy.

## Deploy with Vercel

- Build command: `npm run build`

That’s it — Vercel will build & host the site.
